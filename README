    Skalator is a free learning tool for musical scales on any fretboard.
    App draws a fretboard with notes which are written in top edit text. Those notes are sounds on thickest string.
    Application allows easy pitch shift of given scale.
    User can pick one of preset tunings or define new, for any number of strings.

    Scale edit text input format:
    [Name] [intervals]
     Name   can be with spaces but without numbers, when number shows up it is parsed as interval and all letters
            after that number will be ignored as name
     Intervals   list of sounds on thickest string (intervals from 0)  eg  0 2 3 5 7 8 10  (Aeolian)

    Tuning edit text input format  (intervals are inputed differently, read down)
    [Name] [intervals]
     Name   can be with spaces but without numbers, when number shows up it is parsed as interval and all letters
            after that number will be ignored as name
     Intervals  list of intervals between EACH string, so for example standard guitar tuning looks like this:
                0 5 5 5 4 5   explaination: first string, second string is 5 frets higher so 5, etc with rest of strings.
